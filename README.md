## About

another interpreter project I started to get more familiar with golang.<br>
I don't know if I'll finish it, but I hope I will.

## To build and run:

- Download and install [go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- Open the project folder in a terminal or cmd
- Run `go build simpleInterpreter`
- Then to run the program, type `./simpleInterpreter`
- To run a file with the program: `./simpleInterpreter <file_name>`
